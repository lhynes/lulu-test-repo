</h2>
<div> 

A site to explore a wide range of adveture packages and book your trip of a lifetime. 
The Explore More app was designed, developed and deployed but Louise Hynes for 
educational purposes as part of her final preject for the Code Institute Software Development diploma
<br>
In Phase one we are focusing on pre-made packages with the intention to build on this 
and allow users to create their own custom adventure packages.

- “SpaceX" is the first ever travel agency that organizes trips to space with multiple destinations in close collaboration with aerospace entities and governments. 
- The purpose of this web app is to provide customers who would like to travel to space with an online platform where they can book for their very first trip to space. 
- Users can browse for all the trips that are offered by the space travel agency. 
- Different types of trips are offered according to the type of client. 

**Project stakeholders**
- Individuals – the agency offers recreational space travels for individuals.
- Businesses & scientists – the agency offers space travels for businesses and scientists for research purposes.

<a name="user-stories"/>

## User Stories

As a user, I expect:
1. To have convenient access to all the trips that the travel agency offers.
2. The website to have a neat and elegant design with an optimal architecture and layout.
3. The website to be intuitive and easy to navigate so that I can find what I need in the most effective manner.
4. To easily find information i.e. identify key information for a specific trip and, if needed, be able to access more details.
5. To easily find information about the travel company and see their entire range of offers. I also want to have their contact details and be able to get in touch with them through a contact form.  
6. To be able to research trips by destination, departure site and date.
7. To read testimonies from previous passengers and have access to FAQs. 
8. To be able to book a trip and then register/log in to an account with minimal steps to confirm my order.
9. The website to display my order details for each steps of the checkout and receive an email once my booking has been completed. 
10. The website to be fully responsive on any devices: mobile, tablet, desktop. 
11. The website to be fully interactive so that I get clear feedback on any action I undertake (complete a form, process a payment, log in, log out etc…).
12. As a business or scientist, I want to easily find information on the application process and request information to the company.
13. As a client, I want to be able to access (and update) my personal information, upcoming and post bookings.

## Design

### Theme

I wanted to create a website that would "bring" the user to space. I wanted to keep it classy and professional as well. I have tried to put some efforts on selecting visually impacting pictures. 

I have used a free bootstrap theme called [Grayscale](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/grayscale/). I found it absolutely wonderful and I tried my best to stick to the theme while building my website.

### Colors

The three main colors were used throughout this project.

1. White - `#fff`
    - Background
    - Navbar
2. Black - `#161616`
    - background
3. Green - `#64a19d`
    - Buttons
    - Links
    - Some icones

### Typography

- The primary font family is [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) from Google Fonts.
- The second font family - used mainly for headers - is [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round?selection.family=Varela+Round&sidebar.open) also from Google Fonts.

<a name="wireframes"/>

## Wireframes

I have used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. I first brainstormed on the structure and then created the site map. There are some differences with the final project as these wireframes were created during the preparation phase.

# Deployment

<a name="depl-heroku"/>

## Heroku

My application was deployed through [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) using the master branch of my github repository for this project. The following steps were implemented to deploy this project:

1. Install **gunicorn** package to run the application on Heroku.
    - `sudo pip3 install gunicorn`
2. Install **pycopg2** to connect to PostgreSQL
    - `sudo pip3 install psycopg2`
3. Create a **requirements.txt** file
    - `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
4. Create a new Heroku application
    - Sign up to a new account if you do not already have one.
    - Create a new application by clicking on `new` then `create new app`.
    - Set the name of your application and select your region and click on `create app` to finalize the creation of your app. 
5. Install PostgreSQL add-on
    - `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
6. Create a **Procfile** in the root directory
    - content: `web: gunicorn spacex.wsgi:application`
7. Set the following config variables as environment variables:

Config Vars | Value
----------- | -------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`
DATABASE_URL | `<DATABASE_URL>`
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | `<EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD>`
EMAIL_HOST_USER | `<EMAIL_HOST_USER>`
EMAILJS_USER | `<EMAILJS_USER>`
GOOGLE_API_KEY | `<GOOGLE_API_KEY>`
HOSTNAME | `<HOSTNAME>`
SECRET_KEY | `<SECRET_KEY>`
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE | `<STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE>`
STRIPE_SECRET | `<STRIPE_SECRET>`
USE_AWS | `<TRUE>`

5. In the `Deploy` tab, choose `Connect Github` as **Deployment Method** and *Enable Automatic Deployment* from the Github master branch so that any new commit will be automatically deployed through your heroku app. 

<a name="depl-gitpod"/>

## Local Deployment (GitPod)

To deploy this project locally using gitpod you will have to create a gitpod account and use a web browser with a stable internet connection as gitpod is an online IDE. I suggest you use Chrome as web browser so that you can use gitpod chrome extension to speed up the deployment process. 

1. Create a Gitpod account (if not already)
    - Go to [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io)
    - Click on `Go to App` and click on the green `Authorize gitpod.io`
    - Agree to the terms and then create your free account
2. Add gitpod browser extension for Chrome:
    - Go to [GitPod Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
    - Search for "gitpod" in chrome web store search bar
    - Click on `Add to Chrome` then click on `Add to extension`
3. Clone this project repository from github
    - Go to my [repository](https://github.com/AlexiaDelorme/project-spacex) for this project.
    - If you successfully installed the gitpod browser extension you should view a green `Gitpod` button in the top right corner of the repository (next to `Clone or download` button). Click the `Gitpod` button. 
    - This will allow you to open this repository directly in gitpod for editing.
4. Set the following environment variables for the project:

Env Vars | Value
----------- | -------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | `<EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD>`
EMAIL_HOST_USER | `<EMAIL_HOST_USER>`
EMAILJS_USER | `<EMAILJS_USER>`
GOOGLE_API_KEY | `<GOOGLE_API_KEY>`
HOSTNAME | `<HOSTNAME>`
SECRET_KEY | `<SECRET_KEY>`
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE | `<STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE>`
STRIPE_SECRET | `<STRIPE_SECRET>`

5. The default local database for django projects is SQLite 3.
6. Download all the dependencies necessary to run this project and listed in the **requirements.txt** file. 
    - Run the following command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
7. Create a local development server:
    - In the workspace run the following command `Python3 manage.py runserver`.
    - You should now have a gitpod link to the deployed app.

# Credits

<a name="content"/>

### Content

- For the concept of this web app, (as you could guess) I got inspired by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). I decided to keep the same name to make it more realistic, I don't think it would be an issue as it is a project for educational purposes only.
- For content related to microgravity, scientific experiments, general terms & conditions, and safety guidelines, I have used information from [AirZeroG](https://www.airzerog.com/). This company organizes parabolic flights in Europe for the general public.
- For content specifically related to the trips, I looked online to get the distance from earth, moon etc... I researched a list of launch sites. I have set the price and duration of each trip myself - even though for some trips it's not that realistic (Mars).

### Media

- I created the logo of this website thanks to [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com).
- All the images used for this project were found on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com).
