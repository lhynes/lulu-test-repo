# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy Plane
The main target audience for Prickly
- Age 15 - 45 as the product itself is filled with puns that might not be attractive to an older demographic.
- Users interested in cacti.
- Users interested in decorating their space.
- Users working with computers and interested in health benefits connected to cacti and computers.
- Users who don't feel discouraged by monthly subscription services.

The user can purchase individual items on the site which makes the site available to anyone visiting. However, due to the younger target audience, the main business model is subscription based to match up with multiple modern products. Each month users have the opportunity, based on their subscription value, to choosing new products that are delivered to them. This creates a fun aspect, inviting users to return and possibly purchase more products.

Research
- This is a B2C model, hence the website makes use of larger images/graphics and less text
- There are only a few cacti dedicated e-commerce sites, and none that I came across offering subscription services
- People purchasing items online are mostly impulse shopping and not many users like to register for new pages. This is why a subscription model is used to increase the number of returning users.

Features worth doing
- A Roadmap was used to identify which objectives are worth achieving. All objectives/high-level features were listed and scored on a 1-5 scale (5 being the most important) if they are Important or Viable. The importance score was summed together while the Viability scored was averaged and multiplied by the number of features. Since these numbers did not equal, they were plotted on the Importance/Viability graph to identify the most important ones and the ones that, for now, will be left out.

## Surface Plane

- #### Color scheme
    - The color scheme chosen for this project is muted pastels to go well with the colorful images. It is my view that if I had chosen a more bold color palette, it would be too hectic and too busy looking. Creating a messy look and feel for the website. The main three colors used are Cadet Blue Crayola (#B3BCC9), Gainsboro(#E4DADC), and Opal (#A9C6C4). Secondary colors were Shadow Blue (#75859B) and Lavender Gray(#CEC5CC) and darker variations of those for text contrast.

        <img src="./readme_docs/color-palette.png" height="100px" />


- #### Typography
    - This project uses 3 different fonts.
        - Primary font is Sans Serif type of a font called Quicksand. I chose this font to help with readability and to add to the simplistic color scheme. I wanted the site to feel clean and modern and not too overcrowded. This font was used for most of the text and links.

        <img src="./readme_docs/quicksand.png" height="100px" />

        - The secondary font is a Serif type of font Bodoni Moda. This font goes well together with a sans serif font like Quicksand to provide a contrast in style and with that capture reader's attention and make the site a bit more interesting and dynamic. This font was used for most of the headings.

        <img src="./readme_docs/bodoni.png" height="100px" />


        - The last font used is Caveat. This font is just used as a decoration as I was looking for something that would resemble handwriting. Even though I want the design of the site to feel sophisticated, I also wanted to give it a fun personality which I think can be partially achieved by imitating handwritten headings or signs.

        <img src="./readme_docs/caveat.png" height="100px" />

        - Additionally, [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used to emphasize the point, use for buttons, or just to add to the design.

- #### Imagery
    - Images
        - The primary reason for using images is for informative purposes. Images are displayed in item cards to allow users to visually engage with items added by other users and decide if they are interested in the item.
        The secondary purpose of the images is aesthetic. The images displayed on cards are kept quite large and the same size while not being distorted. This attributes to the clean, organized look of the website. An image is also used as a hero image that takes the full screen to separate the page and not distract the user from the message on the landing page.
        All images have been taken from [unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/) and minified using [tinyJPG](https://tinypng.com/)

    - Graphics
        - Graphics are mainly used to associate the membership with a cactus size. The smaller cactus graphic is used for BAsic membership and the larger ones are used for paid memberships which should allow the user to make visual association as well. Graphics were also used on the HOme page as decoration to go along with the 'How it works' text.Icons were taken from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

- #### Other 
    - All headings and navbar links were given half of a background color that looks like is offset from the top. Three primary colors were used interchangeably on all pages but the design remained the same. I believe this adds to my vision of a clean but modern-looking site.

    - All buttons have the same design of having a border in one of the primary colors and have a hover effect with background fill. 

    - I used [Bootstrap 5.0]() as the front end framework to help with layout and easy pre-built components such as accordeons

    - [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) and built-in Bootstrap toast were used for notifications and cart toast

    - For hamburger menu animations, jonsuh.com(https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/) was used

# Deployment

## Local
Instructions to run the project on your local device using an IDE

### Pre-requisites
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - used to write the code and to run the project
- [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - used to install packages
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - used for version control
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any IDE of your choice - used to compile the code.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie) Account




### Recommended
- A virtual environment of your choice - used to contain all installations and packages and prevents clashing projects that might use the same package but different versions.
    - Python 3 has a built-in virtual environment [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The commands might differ depending on your Operating System, it is advised to read the docs to ensure accuracy. To initialize on MacOS:

            python3 -m venv .venv
        where `.venv` is the name/path you are giving to the virtual environment

### Steps
1. Go to the project [repository](https://github.com/LigaMoon/Prickly)
1. Get the files used by using one of the methods below:
    - Download the files used by clicking the 'Code' button located in the top section of the repository. Then select 'Download ZIP' and unzip the files in the directory of your choice.

        <img src="./readme_docs/zip.png" height="200px" /> 
    
    - Clone the repository by running the following command from your IDE

            gh repo clone LigaMoon/Prickly
    
1. In your IDE, navigate to the project directory where you located downloaded files/cloned the repo

        cd path/to/your/folder
1. Activate your virtual environment. If using Python's venv:

        source .venv/bin/activate
    on MacOS and Unix where .venv is the name you gave previously

        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    on Windows where .venv is the name you gave previously

1. Install all reqauirements from [requirements.txt](requrements.txt) file
    
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

1. Create a file `env.py` to store environment variables
1. Add environment variable in the format as shown below and also demonstrated in the [sample_env.py](sample_env.py) file

        os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
        os.environ.setdefault('DEVELOPMENT', '1')
        os.environ.setdefault('ALLOWED_HOSTS', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
        os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
        os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
        os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET_CH', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
        os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET_SUB', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
    where 
    -  `SECRET_KEY` value is a key of your choice, to ensure appropriate seccurity measures, this can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
    -  `DEVELOPMENT` is set to `1` and is ised in settings.py logic to ensure file is dynamic between local and remote setups
    - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` values are obatined from the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie) website

### Steps
1. In Heroku, go to **Resources** and search for **Heroku Postgres**, we will use this as our development database
    - Select 'Hobby Dev - Free' and click to Submit Order Form

1. Comment out the 'SQLite and Postgres databases' section in the `settings.py` file and uncomment 'Postgres Database' section. Add your `DATABASE_URL` link obtained from Heroku Config Vars

        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-url-goes-here')
        }
1. Migrate your models to Postgres SQL database

        python3 manage.py migrate

1. If you have a JSON file with products displayed on the site, import them now in this order

        python3 manage.py loaddata categories
        python3 manage.py loaddata products

1. Create a superuser that will be used to access the admin page as well as to manage the database. Enter username, password, and e-mail as required

        python3 manage.py createsuperuser

1. In `settings.py` delete the 'Postgres SQL Database' section (make sure you don't commit your DATABASE_URL link!) and un-comment 'SQLite and Postgres SQL Databases' section - this will allow for use of  either of the databases interchangeably

1. Freeze dependencies in a  requirements.txt file (if it hasn't been created/updated before)

        pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

1. Create a Procfile that tells Heroku to create a web dyno and add the following line in it, where `the-name-of-your-app` is the name of your django project

        web: gunicorn the-name-of-your-app.wsgi:application

1. `Add`, `commit` and `push` your changes up to GitHub

1. Go to Heroku and add all of the following environmental variables (Settings > Reveal Config Vars)

    | Key | Value |
    --- | ---
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your_aws_access__key>`
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your_aws_secret_access_key>`
    DATABASE_URL | `generated automatically`
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your_email_key>`
    EMAIL_HOST_USER | `<your_email>`
    SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `<your_stripe_public_key>`
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `<your_stripe_secret_key>`
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET_CH | `<your_stripe_webhook_key>`
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET_SUB | `<your_stripe_webhook_key>`
    USE_AWS | `True`
    ALLOWED_HOSTS | `<your-heroku-app-url>`
    
1. In Heroku go to **Deploy** that's located at the top of the site

    <img src="./readme_docs/deploy.png" height="100px" /> 

1. Click on the **GitHub** option and connect your GitHub account as well as your repo from GitHub (search for the repo name)

    <img src="./readme_docs/heroku-github-connect.png" height="150px" />

1. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys** and then **Deploy Branch**, you should see a successful build here

    <img src="./readme_docs/deploy-branch.png" height="200px" />

1. Open your app

    <img src="./readme_docs/open-app.png" height="70px" />

1. You should see `static/` folder with your static files in it in you S3 bucket.

1. In your S3 bucket, add `media/` folder.

1. If you didn't use JSON filer for product import, now is a good time to navigate to `your-ulr/admin/` page and add the Products and Categories in.

1. Your app should be deployed and you should be able to see your added products.
